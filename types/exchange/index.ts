// To specify the type of the variables and object properties the API returns 
// and I  and want to display, I created a type file for each API endpoint.

//Here is the type file for the API endpoint: https://api.abyiss.com/v1/exchanges?sapiKey=^

export type Exchange = {
    name: string,
    id: string
